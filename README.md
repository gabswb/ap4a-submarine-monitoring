# ap4a-submarine-monitoring*
Project carried out as part of the subject ap4a (object oriented programming) at the UTBM.

This project aims to build an IOT environment simulator.
It models an ecosystem of sensors designed to monitor the environment
inside a diving submarine.
This ecosystem is based on four different types of sensors to monitor the
temperature, light, humidity and pressure in the submarine. These sensors communicate with a server on which the data transmitted is displayed and/or stored.
